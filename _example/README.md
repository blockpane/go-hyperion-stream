# Examples

This contains examples of how to use the go-hyperion-stream library. 
The [deltas](_deltas/deltas.go) example has more thorough 
comments/explanations than the [actions](_actions/actions.go) example.

The package's [godoc documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blockpane/go-hyperion-stream) 
may also be helpful to first-time users.
