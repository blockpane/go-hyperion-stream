# Examples

This contains examples of how to use the go-hyperion-stream library. 

The [deltas](_deltas/deltas.go) example demonstrates (near) real-time table updates, and 
[actions](_actions/actions.go) shows actions as they occur.

The package's [godoc documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blockpane/go-hyperion-stream) 
may also be helpful to first-time users.
